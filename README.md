# Recommender_system
There are two types of recommender systems: **Content-based** and **Collaborative Filtering**. Content-based recommender tries to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item are, and then recommends items based on those aspects; additionally, collaborative filtering analyses what similar users prefer, and provides a recommendation based on that. On this notebook, a collaborative filtering tool will be programmed using python and Kaggle's [Netflix Prize Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data).
